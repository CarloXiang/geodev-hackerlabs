###Vector Basemaps

Esri has introduced a new set of [vector basemaps](http://www.arcgis.com/home/search.html?q=owner:esri_vector) now in beta release. There are several benefits to vector basemaps including high-res displays, smaller and easier to update and the ability to customize the look and feel of the basemaps. You can see them live [here](http://www.arcgis.com/home/search.html?q=owner:esri_vector).

In this lab you will swap your basemap with a your favorite vector basemap.
