###Vector Basemaps

Esri has introduced a new set of [vector basemaps](http://www.arcgis.com/home/search.html?q=owner:esri_vector) now in beta release. There are several benefits to vector basemaps including high-res displays, smaller and easier to update and the ability to customize the look and feel of the basemaps. You can see them live [here](http://www.arcgis.com/home/search.html?q=owner:esri_vector).

In this lab you will swap your basemap with a your favorite vector basemap.

###Steps

1. Go to [arcgis.com](http://www.arcgis.com) and login. Click `Map`.

2. Click [this link](http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=27970d32436a446dabb3c71cf949115e) 

NOTE: Feel free to use your own map too!

3. Click `Add` to add a vector tile > `Search for Layers` > `In: ArcGIS Online`.

	1. Search for:

		```
		esri_vector tiles
		```
		
	2. Click `Add` and experiment with adding and removing a number of the following layers.
 		
 		```
 		World Street Map
 		World Street Map (Night)
 		World Navigation Map
 		World Topographic Map
 		Dark Gray Canvas
 		Light Gray Canvas
 		...
 		```

	3. Click `Done Adding Layers`.
 
4. To hide the old basemap, in the table of contents, hover over the original basemap (e.g. Dark Gray Canvas) > `More Options` > `Transparency` > 100% and close the dialog.

NOTE: This is how we have to do it for now! ;)

5. Now toggle the vector tile layers on and off until you find the one you like best.

6. Save your map.
